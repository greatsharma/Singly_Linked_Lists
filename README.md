# Singly_Linked_Lists

#### Description: 
                This project consists of creation of a singly linkeds list under c++03 standards
                so anyone having idea with a minimum of C++03 is good to go. The project consists
                of atomic and application based operations with SLL. 
                
                Also the modules are very readable with appropriate variables name so any one who 
                didn't know about c++ and is from different language but have a good grasp of OOPs
                and pointers can easily get the intiution of the driving engine i.e., the algorithm 
                for every operation on SLL.
                
                
#### Prerequisites: 
                Atleast C++03, Pointers, OOP and basics of SLL.

Note: Keep everything within same folder otherwise you have to give the complete path for custom headers
